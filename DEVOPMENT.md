# Development

## Functionallity

- [x] Add `str` type for constant string literals
- [x] Add string literals as valid `rhs` for assignments
- [ ] Add parsing for branching: `if` and `else`
- [ ] Add parsing for loops: `for`, `while`, `loop`, `break` and `continue`
- [ ] Add parsing for compound data types: `struct`
- [ ] Add parsing for scopes: `{}`
- [ ] Add parsing for implementation blocks: `impl`
- [ ] Make `VariableCall` and `FunctionCall` their own nodes
- [ ] Add `&` and `*` to handle references and dereferences
- [ ] Link to `puts()` and later `printf()` in C/C++
